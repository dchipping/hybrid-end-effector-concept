          This work saw the identification and design of five features of an end-effector that uses both suction and fingered grasping, optimised for general-purpose tasking. The proposed design uses tendon actuation to provide underactuated fingered grasping and mechanically self-sealing suction cups. A linearly actuated planetary gearing mechanism is designed into the palm of the end-effector allowing rotation of two of the three fingers to accommodate a wider range of grasps. Finally, a novel fingertip mechanism is also devised to adapt to the contours of geometrically complex objects.
          </p>
          <p>
          To decide on an appropriate finger mechanism, an assessment of various types of finger mechanisms was carried out as seen in the table below. An important consideration was the need to integrate a pneumatic system for the suction cups into each finger. As a result, the compactness of the design was a key constraint.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2">
          The final mechanism chosen used a combination of tendons and pulleys, this is detailed in schematic below. This allowed for the placement of three suction cups along each phalange and three degrees-of-freedom, therefore providing a compact solution with a wide range of motion. Moreover, the resulting design is also underactuated, meaning more degrees of freedom than actuators, which allows the finger to comply to the surface geometries of the object. This is optimal for allowing the suction cups to naturally position themselves on the object with a high-quality seal.
          </p>
          <p>
          Key to operating the finger mechanism was devising an appropriate actuation system to apply tension to the tendons. End-effectors are frequently grouped into two categories: individually actuated fingers and simultaneously actuated fingers. Simultaneously actuation allows the use of a single actuator to contract all fingers in unison. Individual actuation often employs the use of multiple actuators, often one for each finger, allowing for more complex grasping strategies. The decision to use either approach is often dictated by the complexity of the end-effectorâ€™s application, simpler applications often opt for simultaneous actuation as it reduces design complexity and cost.
          <p>
          The ability for suction to reduce both translational and rotational degrees of freedom means a single finger can eliminate the wrenching forces of the grasped object. This allows for the remaining fingers to use force and form closure to completely secure the grasp. This is demonstrated on a book in the figure below, which prevents the spine or cover from dangling and getting damaged, a common occurrence noted in the 2017 Amazon Picking Challenge.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2">
          As a result of the novel grasping strategies that could be achieved, as illustrated above, the design opted for individual actuation thereby maximising the variety of objects that could be grasped. The choice of actuator had to allow for precise control and high holding force when powered off. Servo motors were chosen for these reasons and could be precisely controlled from an Arduino Uno using pulse width modulation.
